## -- Include/exclude patterns UI

Added UI support for include/exclude file filtering patterns on projects. Changes span three files:

- **api.ts**: Added `include` and `exclude` fields to `Project` and `CreateProjectRequest` interfaces. Used `//` line comments instead of `/** */` JSDoc because `["**/*"]` contains `*/` which prematurely closes JSDoc blocks.
- **Projects.tsx**: Added collapsible "Advanced -- File Filtering" section in the creation wizard (step 5). Two textareas for include/exclude patterns, newline-separated. Include defaults to `**/*`. Help text notes safety ignores always apply.
- **ProjectDetail.tsx**: Read-only display of patterns in Details section. Edit mode with textareas. On save, diffs patterns against originals and only includes changed ones in the update payload.

Decision: patterns are edited as newline-separated text in textareas, converted to/from arrays for the API. Simpler than tag-style input and matches gitignore convention.
